## Intro

This is the initial boilerplate to launch a [React Native app](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) sharing a single code base. It shares the 'business logic' (_i.e. actions, containers, reducers_) across the platforms, whilst allowing flexibility in View components to ensure your project looks and feels native in each platform.

Here are the libraries used:

- A shared React and React Native structure
- __Flux architecture__
    - [Redux](https://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/)
- __Routing and navigation__
    - [React Native Router Flux](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux) for native mobile
    - [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) for web
- __Data Caching / Offline__
    - [Redux Persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist)
- __UI Toolkit/s__
    - [Native Base](https://nativebase.io/) for native mobile
    - [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for web
- __Simpler mobile app development__ through
    - [Expo](https://expo.io/)
- __User authentication__ example through
    - [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- __API/Data example__
    - Shows how to read/write data from/to an external API (in our case, [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/))
- __Code Linting__ with
    - [Airbnb's JS Linting](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) guidelines
